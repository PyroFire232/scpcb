I found SCP427, and the wallet in GFX/Items/Documents.
Have moved these to the correct location.
There was also a duplicate of SCP1499, this is in Items/SCPs/*_duplicate

I've also noted the keycard skins are missing.

The ticket and the 2 badges are paper, not junk, because these can be read.
Junk items have no use-action.
